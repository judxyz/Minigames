# Multiday_Ware

## ABOUT
WarioWare is a story-based single player game where there are a total of 3 minigames for the player to beat. Players win based on the amount of games won. Games will become more difficult as they play, giving less time per game and faster gameplay. Players have 3 lives to complete as many levels as they can, and win a corresponding amount of points for each level they successfully complete. There is no ending to the game, the challenge is for the player to complete as many levels as they can before they lose all three lives! The game also tracks high scores for players who beat the most games and obtain the highest score.
